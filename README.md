# JavaScript

JavaScript is the most widely distributed programming language on Earth since every modern web browser relies on it. In this section we'll learn the basics of the JavaScript language as a stepping stone to doing more useful things.

To run this code:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install && bower install` in the root folder of the project
3. Run `grunt`

## Notes
- Only `main.js` is being loaded in the browser
  - All other JavaScript files are for in-class discussion only
  - All looping and flow control examples are wrapped in functions in `main.js` so you can execute them whenever you want in the console
